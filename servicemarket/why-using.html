<h1>For Users</h1>
<p>
  The ServiceMarket makes it easy for you to order any competitive Pokemon for PokeMMO you want.<br>
  <br>
  Other than ingame, the Breeders will make you private offers, meaning only you can see them. That makes the market competitive and you get the best prices.<br>
  <br>
  You can keep track of your order status. The breeder who accepts the order can update the status of it.

<h1>For Breeders</h1>
<p>
  The ServiceMarket makes it easy for you to find new orders. If you have some free room in the next days, just take a look at the orders overview bok.<br>
  You can see all open orders there. Start by making some offers. Keep in mind, you are not the only one giving offers.<br>
  <br>
  Keep the user updated with an order status. The user can see it live.
