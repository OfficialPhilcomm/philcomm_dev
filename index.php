        <h1>about me</h1>
        <p>My name is Philcomm</p>
        <p>I am a mage.</p>
        <p>Level 21.</p>
        <p>
          In my eleventh year I became an orphan. When orcs raided my home town, I got split from my parents. A clan of druids found me and raised me as their own.
        </p>
        <p>
          I spend much time learning the mystic arts of magic, and have searched for ways to improve it.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I reached the 20th level, I decided to travel the lands of Germania to gain more XP and level up. I first came upon the humanoid city called Berlin.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this moment perhaps you are wondering... What is he talking about?
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, obviously this is not my real origin story, but it isn't far from the truth.<br>
          Replace 'magic' with 'development' and the story above is pretty damn accurate.
        </p>
        <p>
          My name is Philipp, I am a software developer currently located in Berlin, Germany.
        </p>
        <p>
          Software development is my passion, even if I am not at work.<br>
          At my job, I am mostly working with Android and Ruby on Rails.<br>
          In my freetime, I experiment with technologies such as AI, physics calculations and hardware encryption.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I am not developing (which is rarely the case), I like to hike, skate, read or play video games.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2019, I came in touch with a Dungeons and Dragons YouTube channel called Pen & Blade. Since then, we work together on all sorts of content.<br>
          In July 2020, we started the Pen & Blade podcast, where we just casually talk about stuff we have an interest in.
