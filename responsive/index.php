        <h1>about me</h1>
        <p>
          My name is Philcomm. I am a mage on level 21.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the age of two, I became my orphan. When the orcs raided my home town, my parents got killed by saving me. A clan of druids found me and raised me as their own.
        </p>
        <p>
          I spend a lot of time learning about magic, and searched for ways to improve it.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I got to level 20, I decided to travel the lands of germania, to gain more experience with magic. The first stop on my journey is the mystic wastelands called Berlin.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point you are probably like: what is he talking about... Well, obviously this is not my real origin story, but it is pretty much the truth.<br>
          Replace magic with development, and the story above is damn accurate.
        </p>
        <p>
          My name is Philipp, I am a software developer currently located in Berlin, Germany.
        </p>
        <p>
          Software development is my passion, even if I am not at work.<br>
          At my job, I am mostly working with Android and Ruby on Rails.<br>
          In my freetime, I experiment with technologies such as AI, physics calculations and hardware encryption.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I am not developing (which is rarely the case), I like to hike, skate, read or play video games.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2019, I came in touch with a Dungeons and Dragons YouTube channel. Since then, we work together on content.<br>
          In 2020, we started the Pen & Blade podcast, where we just casually talk about stuff we have an interest in.
