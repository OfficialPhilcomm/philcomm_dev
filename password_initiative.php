        <h1>save password initiative</h1>
        <p>
          Everybody knows that internet privacy is important. Today, we are doing
          so much online, that perhaps losing the key to your home is not as harmful
          as getting your passwords leaked.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's why it is very important to have safe passwords. But just your name
          with a number and one capital letter doesn't do the trick.
        </p>
        <p>
          A lot of people don't use save passwords because they fear forgetting them, me included.
          So I came up with a system that works good for me, and it might help other people too.
          That's why I am sharing it here.
